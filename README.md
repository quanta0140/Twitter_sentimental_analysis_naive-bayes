# Twitter_sentimental_analysis_naive-bayes
Objective:
- Implemented an Natural Language Processing(NLP) Twitter sentiment analysis model that helps to overcome
the challenges of sentiment classification of tweets which is to classify tweets automatically as positive, negative,
or neutral based on their content.
- To classify the text based on the mentality expressed in the text, which can be positive, negative, or neutral
- In this era of social media it is very easy to spread hate speech and racist remarks online. Different social media platforms have been leveraging the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to flag the comments which are related to hate and racism. In this project a twitter sentiment analysis is done from a dataset contatining real world tweets from twitter.

Approach:
- Performed various pre-processing steps on the dataset of over 150 tweets that mainly dealt with removing special
characters like emojis, and hashtags by Stemming and Lemmatization
- Evaluated the models by certain classifiers and deep learning algorithms like RNN
- Logistic Regression, SVM, and Naive Bayes ML algorithms have been used.
- Pre-processed the data using different methods of Natural Language Processingâ€™s (NLP) NLTK library and
feeding it into ML models to give the best accuracy

Result:
 - Businesses can use sentiment analysis to stay up-to-date about the sentiments around their brand.
- Using this model, we can get peopleâ€™s opinions regarding specific topics on social media or social networking sites.
